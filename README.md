  Home Brewing Inventory App
</h1>

I built this app for my brother to help him manage the inventory for his home brewing initiative. This app allows him to efficiently track and manage the key ingredients in his brewing process, organized into three main categories: Hops, Malts, and Yeasts. Each category allows him to add, view, update, and delete items, while ensuring actions are based on brewing-specific restrictions, such as Hops' alpha acid levels (ranging between 1-22%) or Yeasts' attenuation (ranging between 60-90%), between others.

The app also features a visual indicator for brewing items. In the index view, card images dynamically change color based on specific values like the alpha acid levels for Hops or the type of Malts.

- **Tailwind CSS**: for styling.
- **JavaScript**: to handle quantity updates, animations, and effects.
- A **PostgreSQL** database set up supported by **rapidapp.io**.
- A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that integrates **a2hs.js** to allow my brother to add the app to his mobile home screen for a seamless mobile experience.

Overall, the Home Brewing Inventory App is tailored to my brother's brewing needs, ensuring simplicity and functionality while keeping it adaptable for future updates.

The project is hosted on the free tier of **Render.com**, providing reliable (but sometimes slow) hosting.
